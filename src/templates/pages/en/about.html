                        Civis is a citizen science platform developed by the Brazilian Institute of Information in
                        Science and Technology (IBICT) using open-source code,
                        based on <a href="https://eu-citizen.science/">EU-Citizen.Science</a>.

                    <p>
                        Our goal is to provide infrastructure and content that help broaden the understanding of citizen science,
                        promote its use, and support the development of initiatives and the application of methodologies in this field,
                        with a focus on Latin America and the Caribbean.

                    <p>
                        Citizen science is a branch of the open science movement. It is a broad concept, encompassing several diverse initiatives,
                        approaches, and methodologies that seek to perfect and promote non-scientist contributions and engagement in knowledge,
                        data, and information analysis and production activities that are relevant to science and issues of social,
                        environmental, and territorial importance.
